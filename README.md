## Flashcard App (WIP)

App for creating and showing flashcards from a .txt file.
The flashcard .txt file must follow this format:

- menu.py handles the toolbar in the main window. <br>
- quiz.py is the main/init file. <br>
- flashcardapp.py handles the functions and frames for the flashcard app. <br>
- dialogs.py contains the various dialogs used in menu.py and flashcardapp.py (DeckSelection and NewFile)
